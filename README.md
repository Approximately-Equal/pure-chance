# Welcome

Hello, I'm Chance, and welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm a statistics (and computer science) student with a passion for a vast array of things: computational statistics, linguistics, social choice, game theory, fanfiction, a good video essay, and much more.

In my free time, I develop my web scraping and archival project [AOchivist](https://github.com/Approximately-Equal/AOchivist) as well as my computational social choice library (and undergraduate thesis project) [Kingmaker](https://github.com/Approximately-Equal/Kingmaker)

I also have a [blog](https://pure-chance.xyz) where I write about math, computer science, and statistics. Sometimes I even try and fail to write thoughtful media analysis. I've written such work as: solving the game of greed (out of spite), catching fictional supervillains with Bayesian inference, and ranting about portrayals of nuclear weapons (and war) in media.

## Projects

### Kingmaker

Kingmaker is a modular, performant, social choice framework for the simulation, computation, and analysis of strategic voting. It has a focus on the study of strategic or tactical voting, which is concerned questions such as:

- Which strategies are most effective (for each voting method)?
- How much do they impact election outcomes?
- Which voting methods minimize strategic voting?
- and more

### AOchivist

AOchivist /ˌeɪː.oʊː.ˈkaɪvɪst/ is a local archive for AO3. It can download works, bookmarks, subscriptions, marked for later, and more. It can display works in multiple formats, including html, epub, pdf, and plain text.

Disclaimer: AOchivist claims no relation to _The Ancient Ones_(_AO-chan_). Please don't smite me.

## Adventures

- I (having been dragged along by my father) walked across my home county of Marin over the span of a week. I started at The Golden Gate Bridge, traversed across the through the Marin Headlands, over Loma Alta to College of Marin, and finally over to Novato and out towards Petaluma.

- I circumnavigated Iceland, taking a hike, seeing a waterfall, and relaxing at a hot spring every day. I saw a _lot_ of sheep, hiked to some incredible views (waterfalls, icebergs), and cemented my love for the soundtrack of _  Garden State_.
